 * Store Synchronization

For xpressrun-shipping to offer its service to your customers, you must synchronize your two stores (Woocommerce store and xpressrun store).

. To synchronize the stores, go to xpressrun.com

- Before synchronizing the two stores for the first time, you must provide the default dimensions of the products in the store (when importing products into xpressrun, all products whose dimensions are not provided in Woocommerce will take these default values).
- In the navigation menu, click on products => import then the store. After a few seconds of loading, you will notice that all products that did not exist in the xpressrun store have been properly imported.

* Store Configuration =

For our shipping service to function properly, the xpressrun store must be properly configured. 

Essential configurations include:

- Default package dimension: during the import of products from woocommerce, these dimensions will be used for products that do not have dimensions in woocommerce.

- Preparation time: necessary to automatically send a driver when an order is placed in your store.

- Business hours: the days and hours the store is open, necessary to offer the appropriate service to the customer.

- Delivery & service fees: offers different options for shipping fees, for example, you can offer customers to pay only 50% of the delivery fees (please consult for all available options). By default, the \"Customer pays the full delivery\" option is enabled.
